Code	Description	Notes
400	Bad Request	This is the generic error that tells us someone created a bad request. Perhaps required fields are missing or header values are not filled in.
401	Unauthorized	Indicates that authentication has failed. This could be because of an expired, missing, or invalid token.
403	Forbidden	Indicates that authorization failed. Alternatively, you can also use 404 so that the consumer doesn’t know that the resource even exists.
404	Not Found	The requested resource is not found. Companies like GitHub also use 404 if you try to access a resource that you do not have the authorization to access.
500	Internal Server Error	When something goes wrong on the server, the consumer can’t do anything about it. Just let them know there’s a problem and that they should try again later or contact support.
